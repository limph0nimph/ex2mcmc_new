Code to reproduce paper experiments.

ISIR_Ex2_toyish_gaussian.ipynb: toyish gaussian example
ISIR_toyish_example.ipynb: gaussian mixture example

Scripts my_sample.py and my_sample_banana.py reproduces code for the Funnel and Banana-shape distributions, respectively.

Notebooks Funnel_distribution_reproduce.ipynb and Banana_distribution_reproduce.ipynb reproduces Flex training and visualizations for Funnel and Banana, respectively.

Directory 'minst_experiments' contains notebooks to run the GAN sampling example on MNIST. This part contains pre-trained weights for JS-GAN and WGAN-GP and the laptops are self-contained.

Directory 'cifar10_experiments' contains norebooks to run the CIFAR-10 examples. Due to capacity constraints, we are unable to provide weights for pre-trained models, yet the results could be reproduced with official Mimicry code. We plan to release github with all code and pre-trained models as soon as possible.
